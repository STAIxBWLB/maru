# vault-extract background

## Why the preconditions are strict

- An L02 incident: two notes created by an automated EXTRACT run lacked the required frontmatter fields and were caught only by a later `/vault-lint`.
- An L01 incident: about twenty notes accumulated dead `topics` wiki-links because `topics` was copied verbatim from summary frontmatter without a MOC existence check. The MOC check in the preconditions prevents a recurrence at the write site, and vmem now refuses the same entry (V02).

## Sibling meeting merge rule

The merge-or-split rule for sibling meetings was added after two complementary meeting sources on one initiative were extracted as fragmented notes.
