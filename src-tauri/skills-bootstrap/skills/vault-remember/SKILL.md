# /vault-remember [observation]

> Before the first vmem call, read `lib/vault_adapter.md` §Runtime Discovery and bind the vmem vault id for the workspace `vault.path`; pass it as `vault` on every vmem tool call and as the `<vault>` argument of every `vmem` CLI command.

Record an observation about methodology, process, or friction for later review.

**Not for**: knowledge — facts, decisions, insights about the world or the user's projects belong in `notes/` via `/vault-learn` (approval gate + LEARN log) or `/vault-extract`. `/vault-remember` only writes `ops/observations/` entries that `/vault-rethink` consumes.

## Input
- observation: text describing what was observed

## Categories
- **methodology**: how the vault methodology works (or doesn't)
- **process**: workflow improvements or issues
- **friction**: points where the system feels awkward
- **surprise**: unexpected outcomes (positive or negative)
- **quality**: note quality patterns

## Process

1. Determine category from observation content
2. Create timestamped entry in `ops/observations/` with `vmem_report(path: "ops/observations/<filename>", body)` (vmem screens the text and logs the write). expect: vmem refuses secret-looking text and an unsafe path
3. Filename: YYYYMMDD-brief-description.md
4. Content: observation text, category, context
5. Check the observation count against the rethink threshold: read `maintenance.rethink_observations_threshold` from `ops/config.yaml` (`vmem_read_file`; default 10 when unset) and count the entries with `vmem_list_files(dir: "ops/observations")`

## Rule Zero
The methodology is the spec. Observations accumulate evidence for methodology changes, but changes require explicit /vault-rethink review.

## Output
- Confirmation with category and file path
- Warning if rethink threshold reached
