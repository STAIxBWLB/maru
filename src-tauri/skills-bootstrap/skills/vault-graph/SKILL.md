# /vault-graph [command]

> Before the first vmem call, read `lib/vault_adapter.md` §Runtime Discovery and bind the vmem vault id for the workspace `vault.path`; pass it as `vault` on every vmem tool call and as the `<vault>` argument of every `vmem` CLI command.
>
> Before a vault or workspace build, run `vmem --version`. If it fails or prints a version below 0.8.0, stop and report `vault-graph build needs vmem >= 0.8.0 (found <version, or "no vmem">)`: the deterministic Leiden communities, `--workspace`, the vmem-backed queries (`neighbors`, `orphans`, `backlinks`, `stale`) and the shortest path between two notes (`path`, vmem 0.8.0) need it.

Knowledge graph build, query, and report for vault notes and the workspace layer. No code graph and no graph MCP server.

`vault-graph` owns the graph workflow.

## Shared Runtime

| Item | Path |
|------|------|
| Vault/workspace builder | `vmem graph build <vault> [--workspace]` (MCP `vmem_graph_build`) |

## Commands

### Query Commands (vmem reads, always available)
- **orphans**: notes with no incoming links (`vmem_lint` L03 — an in-link-0, topics-0 finding, so the count matches `/vault-lint`)
- **hubs**: notes with most connections (`vmem_graph_neighbors` `hops: 1` returns `degree` per node; a hub sweep uses the graph report's god-node table)
- **domain [name]**: all notes in a domain (`vmem_search` with `domain`)
- **cross [domain1] [domain2]**: notes linking across domains (`vmem_graph_neighbors` per note with `hops: 1`, comparing the two neighbours' domains)
- **backlinks [note]**: all notes linking to a specific note (`vmem_links` with `direction: "in"`)
- **density**: connection density metrics (graph report totals: nodes, edges, communities, isolates, density)
- **stale [days]**: notes not modified in N days (`vmem_list` `mtime`)

### Build Commands
- **build**: Run community detection + analysis pipeline. Outputs:
  - `vault/reports/vault-graph.json` (node-link JSON)
  - `vault/reports/graph-report-YYMMDD.md` (audit report; 구 리포트는 보존되고 `graph-trend.md`에 빌드마다 행 1개가 추가된다)
- **build --workspace**: Add the work operational layer → `vault/reports/workspace-graph.json` (vault-graph.json untouched; no report written). **On demand only**; the weekly ritual does not build it. See below.
- **neighbors [note]**: 1-hop neighborhood + community of a note through `vmem_graph_neighbors` (no build, no report or `vault-graph.json` read).
- **path [note-a] [note-b]**: shortest link path between two notes through `vmem_graph_path` (no build, no report or `vault-graph.json` read)
- **report**: Read the latest graph report (if < 7 days old)
- **communities**: List detected communities from latest build
- **surprises**: List cross-community surprising connections
- **god-nodes**: Show most-connected non-MOC nodes

## Build Process (`/vault-graph build`)

Options:
- `--vault`: build the vault graph
- `--workspace`: build the vault layer **plus** the work operational layer → `workspace-graph.json`

1. Execute:
   ```bash
   vmem graph build <vault>               # --vault (MCP: vmem_graph_build)
   vmem graph build <vault> --workspace   # --workspace (MCP: vmem_graph_build workspace: true)
   ```
2. Pipeline: read notes → extract graph → deterministic Leiden community detection → god node analysis → surprising connections → report. vmem's graph block carries `partitioner: "leiden"` and its report prints the same name, so use Leiden everywhere (MOCs and business-unit hubs excluded). 커뮤니티 제목은 **anchor 노트**(degree 최대 멤버)로 붙고 정수 id는 "do not cite" 줄에만 남는다(빌드마다 재배정되므로 인용 금지).
3. Outputs:
   - vault: `<vault.path>/reports/vault-graph.json`, `<vault.path>/reports/graph-report-YYMMDD.md` (+ `graph-trend.md` 행 추가, 구 리포트 보존)
   - workspace: `<vault.path>/reports/workspace-graph.json` only (no report or trend row; the result lists the work counters)
4. vmem writes the vault and workspace outputs and records the GRAPH event itself; add no log line. A build whose receipt is `ok: false` names the rule that stopped it; stop and report it.
   The weekly ritual is a **single** vault build, run by the workspace's weekly job (`--workspace` is on-demand only). Order: build → lint → vault push → work pointer bump.

## Neighbors Process (`/vault-graph neighbors <note>`)

1-hop neighborhood + community of a note, read through `vmem_graph_neighbors`, which builds the graph from the current index on each call (no report read, no `jq`, no rebuild). Used by the workspace's context-enrichment graph-neighborhood step.

```text
vmem_graph_neighbors(path: "<stem>", hops: 1, limit: 50)   # MCP
vmem graph neighbors <vault> <stem> --hops 1 --limit 50     # CLI
```

- The result carries `nodes` (each with `community` and `degree`), the `edges` among them and `truncated`; `hops: 2` widens the walk and `relation` (`wiki_link` or one typed relation) narrows the edge set.
- Report the node's `community`, its degree-ranked neighbors (≤10), and same-community co-members.
- Backlinks, orphans and staleness come from vmem too: `vmem_links(path, direction: "in")`, `vmem_lint` L03, and `vmem_list` `mtime` — never a ripgrep pass over `notes/`.
- expect: vmem refuses `hops` outside 1–2, a `limit` outside 1–500, an unknown `relation` and an unknown note.

## Path Process (`/vault-graph path <note-a> <note-b>`)

Shortest link path between two notes, read through `vmem_graph_path`, which builds the graph from the current index on each call (no report read, no `jq`, no rebuild).

```text
vmem_graph_path(from: "<stem-a>", to: "<stem-b>", maxHops: 6)                        # MCP
vmem graph path <vault> <stem-a> <stem-b> [--max-hops 1..6] [--relation REL] [--via-hubs] [--json]   # CLI
```

- The walk is undirected BFS with neighbours visited in code-point order, so the same pair and options always return the same path. The result carries `found`, `length` in hops, the ordered `nodes` and the `edges` between them (each edge keeping its `relation`).
- `maxHops` is 1–6 and defaults to 6: a pair farther apart than that comes back `found: false`, not as an error.
- `viaHubs` is off by default, so `moc` and `bu` hubs are not intermediate steps; set it when the only route runs through a MOC. `relation` (`wiki_link` or one typed relation) narrows the edge set.
- expect: vmem refuses `maxHops` outside 1–6, an unknown `relation` (`use wiki_link or supports, contradicts, extends, applies-to, context-for`), and an unknown `from` or `to` note. `from` equal to `to` returns `found: true, length: 0`; a pair with no route within `maxHops` returns `found: false` with `length: 0` and empty `nodes`/`edges`, a result and not a refusal.

## Report Process (`/vault-graph report [target]`)

1. Resolve report directory: `<vault.path>/reports/graph-report-*.md`.
2. Select newest report and warn if older than 7 days.
3. Read it with `vmem_read_file`.
4. Summarize overview, god nodes, top communities, surprising connections, and isolate count.

## Query Process (`/vault-graph query "<question>" [options]`)

An ad-hoc graph question is a vmem read, never a pass over `graph.json`. Pick the read that matches the question:

| Question | Read |
|---|---|
| open question about a topic | `vmem_brief` with the question as `intent` |
| words that must appear in a note | `vmem_search` |
| what surrounds one note | `vmem_graph_neighbors` (`hops: 2`, optional `relation`) |
| what links to one note | `vmem_links` with `direction: "in"` |
| how two notes are connected | `vmem_graph_path` (`from`/`to` stems; `maxHops` 1–6, `relation`, `viaHubs`) |
| vault-wide shape (hubs, communities, cross-community links) | latest graph report, after `/vault-graph build` when it is stale |

## Integration

- `/vault-connect` Step 0 discovers candidates with `vmem_brief` and `vmem_graph_neighbors`, never by reading this report
- `/vault-sync` duplicates come from `vmem_brief` with the source path; the graph report is not a dedup signal
- `/vault-lint` checks L11 (graph staleness > 7 days), L12 (island communities, reported by member list)
- `skill-mine` mines skill candidates with `vmem skills mine`, which uses the same deterministic Leiden communities
- The workspace agent guide may point T2/T3 operations at the graph report before a full vault search
